The Blockchain Freedom Foundation invites your institution to become a sponsor today of the Utah Bitcoin Conference on Friday, October 1st, 2021. 
This conference is to introduce beginners to blockchain technology so they too can be onboarded into the digital age. 
From observation, people of color, minorities and women are being left out of the cryptocurrency migration, so we launched this Foundation to help bridge that gap. 
I've spelled the problem and the solutions we're undertaking to address the issues on the sponsorship guide here https://utahbitcoinconference.com/images/sponsors/bitcoin-sponsors-guide.pdf 
I'm dedicating my daily iHeart Radio show to help propel the adoption and migration on three stations targeting three unique audience (average consumer, financial sector, beginners). 
Will you consider making a financial pledge of $10,000 or more and participate in an active role in supporting this mission to spread knowledge of and access to advanced technologies like blockchain and cryptocurrencies.
This knowledge should be made available to all people, but specifically to people of color, minorities, and women so they too may participate and enhance their human experience, build wealth, and get on the path to prosperity, this will result in improved planetary existence for all. Please review our sponsorship guide and commit your support today. See more details here https://utahbitcoinconference.com/images/sponsors/bitcoin-sponsors-guide.pdf 
Sincerely,
iHeart Charlene the Crypto Queen
